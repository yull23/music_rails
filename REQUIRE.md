# REQUIREMENTS

## Music Store

An entrepreneur has contacted your team seeking a technology partner for his new business idea. Fighting against the discography monopolies of the world, the venture consists of an online store for independent artists. The goal is to start modeling the first MVP for albumsÂ©. These are the business requirements:

- The store will sell music albums to their customers
- Each album has a name and a price (stored in cents). An album has many songs and belongs to an artist (only to one artist). A valid album always has a name and a price greater than zero.
- A song has a name and duration (in seconds). A song belongs only to one album. A song should always have a name and its duration cannot be zero or less.
- An artist has a name, nationality, birth_date, and death_date. Only the name is mandatory. If we store the birth_date, it cannot be in the future and if we store a death_date two conditions should be met: the birth_date exists and the death_date is after the birth_date. An artist could have many albums.
- The customer can place orders in the store. Each order has a date and a total (the sum of the product of the quantity and price of each album included on the order). An order could include many albums and an album could appear y many orders. We need to store how many copies of an album are purchased in each order. This quantity should be positive. The order total cannot be negative and the date cannot be in the future.
- A customer has a username, email, password, name, and an active flag (could be true or false). The email should have an email format, the username is required, the password should have a length of at least 6 characters and includes at least one number. By default, a customer is active on creation. Both username and email should be unique.
